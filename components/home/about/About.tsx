                Hey! I&apos;m Femi Arnaud AKOTONOU, for the full name. <br />
                I&apos;m  a young frontend developper with over 4 years of experience by now. I specialize in frontend development, mainly javascript stacks.
                I have good understanding of SQL and NoSQL databases, but I like to turn to SaaS solutions like Supabase or Firebase when it comes to design my backends

                I have experience with mobile development, with Ionic and NativeScript frameworks.
                I also had to collaborate on a React Native project in a short time.
                Last year I didn&apos;t spend much time on mobile development but I plan to get back to it with Flutter and ReactNative since they are the most popular frameworks on the market today.

                I&apos;m passively looking for new positions where I can merge my

                you&apos;ve got an opening that I might like, let&apos;s connect
